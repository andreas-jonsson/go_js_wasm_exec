Proof of Concept
================

This is a proof of concept on how to use WebAssembly binaries generated by the Go compiler in a non-web (non-JS)
environment. Currently `println` and `fmt.Println` are supported. It is mostly a direct translation of https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/misc/wasm/wasm_exec.js. Please note that this interface is not public or stable, it may change with future versions of Go.
